### Level three: adding significant value to the conversation

To drive the most impact from your trend jacking, don’t just add your voice to the chorus of conversation — dig deep and provide significant value through your content.

For example, audience research tool SparkToro used advanced trend jacking techniques when responding to a hot take from Elon Musk about Twitter’s percentage of fake users. As Amanda Nativdad writes, using their existing foundational tools, their team was “quick to parse through data to answer the question everyone was wondering about.” Within a few days of Musk’s headline-generating tweet, they published research that showed around 20% of Twitter’s accounts were fake or spam — much higher than the 5% rate initially reported.

SparkToro’s findings generated significant press coverage, drove 23k unique pageviews of their website in a single day, and helped greatly improve their organic search rankings for terms like ‘audience research tool.’

Recently, I came across an intriguing article titled [Reconsidering Web Development Paradigms](https://www.rethinkwebdev.com) by an experienced developer, which prompted me to reflect on my own approach to web development. The piece offers a critical analysis of popular frameworks, challenging the status quo.

In this post, I'll share my thoughts on several key aspects, including:

```jsx title="pages/index.tsx"
export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8">
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8">
        {/* Images will go here */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best practices for all B2B trend jacking

Not every company is equipped to publish a proprietary data report within days — but even a simple meme is important to get right. If you’re just getting started with trend jacking, there are a few best practices to keep in mind.

### Stay relevant to YOUR audience

This is the secret advantage B2B marketers have when it comes to trend jacking: you don’t need to wait for a national event like the Super Bowl or a Barbie-level blockbuster. Since your audience is smaller than B2C brands like Oreo, you can be more surgical about the events you trend jack (and you won’t be competing with dozens of other marketing teams who’ve all had the same idea).

## Embracing Evolution

The landscape of web development has evolved significantly since the inception of frameworks like Next.js. The introduction of new web platform features and APIs has empowered developers to leverage the full potential of the platform. It's essential to embrace this evolution and adapt to emerging technologies.

## Framework Independence and Self-Hosting

```jsx title="pages/index.tsx"
export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8">
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8">
        {/* Images will go here */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The ability of a framework to operate independently and facilitate self-hosting is a crucial factor for many developers. While some frameworks may excel in specific hosting environments, the emphasis should be on ensuring that the framework remains adaptable and can be deployed anywhere without unnecessary constraints.

## Open Source Principles and Framework Boundaries

Open source principles play a vital role in the collaborative development of frameworks. Striking a balance between open accessibility and well-defined boundaries ensures that frameworks can evolve and integrate seamlessly with other tools and platforms.

## Navigating the Relationship Between Frameworks and Infrastructure

The relationship between frameworks and infrastructure is intricate. While frameworks like Next.js offer default deployment options, it's crucial to maintain flexibility for developers who prefer self-hosting or alternative hosting solutions. Clear delineation between the responsibilities of the framework and the infrastructure it runs on is key.

## The Dynamic Between Frameworks and JavaScript Libraries like React

Frameworks often build on JavaScript libraries like React, and their collaboration is integral to the developer experience. Ensuring clear communication and collaboration between framework maintainers and library developers can lead to a cohesive ecosystem that benefits both developers and end-users.

## Striking the Right Balance Between Stability and Innovation

Balancing stability and innovation is an ongoing challenge for framework developers. While introducing new features and capabilities is essential, maintaining stability ensures a reliable experience for developers and users alike. Thoughtful release strategies, community feedback, and robust testing contribute to finding the right equilibrium.

## Examining the Notion of "Magical" Frameworks

The concept of "magical" frameworks, which automate certain processes to enhance developer productivity, is a topic of discussion. Striking a balance between automation and transparency is crucial. Frameworks should empower developers without obscuring essential details, fostering a deeper understanding of the underlying processes.

### Answer

It seems that there was a mistake in providing the background color. The correct background color is HSL 0 0 7%. To adjust the color of the unsorted list ::marker while maintaining good contrast with this background color, you can try the following color options:

1. HSL 0 0 20%: This color is lighter than your background, with a 20% lightness, which can help maintain contrast while being closer to the dark gray color.
2. HSL 0 0 30%: This color has a higher lightness (30%) than the background, which can provide more contrast while still being within the dark gray range.
3. HSL 0 0 40%: This color has an even higher lightness (40%) than the background, which can provide more contrast while still being within the dark gray range.

You can apply these colors to the unsorted list `::marker` using CSS:

```js
css
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}

ul::marker {
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 40%);
}
```
